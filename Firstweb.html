<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>    
<blockquote><q><i>Hello World</q>redirects here. For other uses, see Hello World (disambiguation).

<p>A <q>Hello, World!</q> program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message <q>Hello, World!</q>. Such a program is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is often the first program written by people learning to code.<sup>[1][2]</sup> It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.
